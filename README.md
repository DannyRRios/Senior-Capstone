<h1>My Senior Capstone</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
For my senior project to complete my bachelor's degree, I created a full fledged environment in Microsoft Azure which had to be properly secure and met all standards that a small college that contained the elements of Payment Card Industry, FERPA, HIPAA, Non-Disclosure (Proprietary) Information)  and Other undetermined PII. A penetration team was then brought in where we had to remediate any flaws in our system that was taken advantage of. We also had to create many documents beforehand for the college including a Enterprise Data Classification Plan, Asset Management Plan, Enterprise Risk Management Plan, Enterprise Technology Usage Plan, Incident Response Plan, Acceptable Use Policy, Configuration and Change Management Plan and lastly a Secure Configuration Plan.

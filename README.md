<h1>My Senior Capstone - Enterprise Information Security Program Plan</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
For my senior project to complete my bachelor's degree, I along with two other team members were required to creat a Enterprise Information Security Program Plan for a small College that contained the elements of Payment Card Industry, FERPA, HIPAA, Non-Disclosure (Proprietary) Information) and Other undetermined PII. This included but was not limited to creating a full fledged environment in Microsoft Azure which had to be properly secured and met all standards that would be needed for the small college's needs. We also had to create many documents beforehand for the college including a Enterprise Data Classification Plan, Asset Management Plan, Enterprise Risk Management Plan, Enterprise Technology Usage Plan, Incident Response Plan, Acceptable Use Policy, Configuration and Change Management Plan and lastly a Secure Configuration Plan.A penetration team was then brought in where we had to remediate any flaws in our system that was taken advantage of.

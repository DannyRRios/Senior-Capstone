<h1>My Senior Capstone - Enterprise Information Security Program Plan</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

- <b>Part One</b>
  - For my senior project, two other team members and I were required to create an Enterprise Information Security Program Plan for a small college that contained elements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), FERPA, HIPAA, Non-Disclosure (Proprietary) Information, and other undetermined Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Within the Enterprise Information Security Program Plan there was many other plans included which were but not limited to an Enterprise Data Classification Plan, Asset Management Plan, Enterprise Risk Management Plan, Enterprise Technology Usage Plan, Incident Response Plan, Acceptable Use Policy, Configuration and Change Management Plan, and a Secure Configuration Plan. 
- <b>Part Two</b>
  - For the second half of this project we were required to put everything that we had planned into action and create a fully functional environment in Microsoft Azure, which had to be properly secured and meet all necessary standards for the small collegeâ€™s needs.  A penetration testing team was then brought in, and we had to remediate any flaws in our system that were exploited.
